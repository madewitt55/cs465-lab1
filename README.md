## Read the following, then delete it & add your content in its place

This is the starter template for Lab1 CS465 Spring 2026.

This repository will be cloned into a new repo just for you! You can then clone that 
repository down to your development laptop and get started. I will also have access to your
repository for grading purposes.

**Fill in the information at the top of this README.md**

As you work on the lab, you should regularly `git push` back to the classroom repository on GitHub.
When you are finished, be sure to add/commit/push one last time!

Note: I will _only_ grade what's in the `main` branch of your personal repo created by GitHub
Classroom.
